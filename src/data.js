Turreted fairy-tale castles grace the enchanting countryside of dense woodlands and gently flowing rivers. The entire area of the Loire Valley, a lush area known as the Garden of France, is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Some of the Loire castles are medieval fortresses built on hilltops and surrounded by ramparts. However, the most famous Loire châteaux are sumptuous Renaissance palaces that were designed purely for enjoyment and entertaining, as an extension of court life outside of Paris. The Château de Chambord, built for King Francis I, is the most magnificent château; Château de Chenonceau has a distinctive feminine style; and the Château de Cheverny is a Neoclassical-style manor house in idyllic surroundings. It is also worth visiting the UNESCO-listed cathedrals in Chartres and Bourges as well as the city of Orléans, where Joan of Arc helped defeat the English army in 1429, and the Château Royal d'Amboise, the residence of French kings for five hundred years.",

It measures an impressive 26 meters in height, which includes the Quadriga, the spectacular four-horse chariot carrying the goddess of victory perched atop this spectacular building. Its six huge columns on each side of the structure form five impressive passages: four were used by regular traffic, while the center was reserved for the royal carriages. Huge Doric columns also decorate the two buildings at each side of the Gate, once used by toll-collectors and guards. Berlin's most iconic structure, it's hard to believe that the majestic structure you see today was severely damaged during WWII. It was also once part of the infamous Berlin Wall and, for a few decades, was symbolic of the division of Berlin into East and West.",

Other highlights include the panoramic views from the South Towers, the 12th- and 13th-century stained glass in the Three Kings Chapel, and the Treasury with its many precious objects, all of which survived largely intact after WWII.

The capital city of the state of Bavaria can trace its roots all the way back to the 12th century when a monastery was established here, and quickly grew into the region's most important place of trade and commerce. Central to this rise was Marienplatz, the large square where traders from across Bavaria would meet to conduct business, and where locals would congregate to shop and watch medieval jousting tournaments. These days, this vast square still draws crowds of people, but for different reasons: they're here for sightseeing or possibly to enjoy a visit to one of square's trendy cafés and restaurants, or to shop in its unique boutique stores. The points of interest for tourists are plentiful. Here, you'll find both the new and old town halls, the Neues Rathaus and Altes Rathaus, where much of the city's history was written. Both are attractive and worth a visit. Other landmarks include the tall monument to the Virgin Mary, the Mariensäule built in 1638, as well as the elegant Fischbrunnen, a 19th-century fountain with its bronze figures. For a truly memorable experience, why not consider a visit in winter? If so, you'll be rewarded with the chance see the Marienplatz come alive with a spectacular display of lights and ornaments during the annual Christmas Market. Other winter festivals are held here, too, including the ancient, month-long Fasching carnival. Held each January to February locals and visitors alike partake in fun dances and events that have been held here for centuries. Visit Marienplatz at any time of year and you'll still have fun. From March through to October you can witness the Neues Rathaus' famous glockenspiel perform its merry dance, its mechanical figures thrilling viewers thrice daily in a performance that has been enjoyed since 1908.",

Berchtesgaden, at the end of the Deutsche Alpenstrasse, is perhaps the best-known tourist town and one of the most popular mountain resorts in the Bavarian Alps.

Instead of a traditional wood or metal dome, a decision was made to use glass, transforming the space into a major tourist attraction in the process.From here, visitors can enjoy great city views, which are even more dramatic at night. If planning to enjoy the view in the evening, try to catch a spectacular sunset from the on-site Rooftop Restaurant.

Famous sights, like the incredible granite domes of El Capitan and Half Dome, have to be seen in person to fully appreciate their grandeur. The massive waterfalls that tumble off sheer cliffs from mountain snowfall or sudden summer rainstorms are another of the park's highlights. Yosemite National Park is full of activity-based things to do that include hiking, climbing, walking, and horseback riding. Hiking trails in Yosemite lead to some of the most scenic areas and are a good way to escape the crowds at lookouts.",

The Upper Town rests on 100-meter-high cliffs and is home to the Citadel, the Plains of Abraham, Place d'Armes, and the Parque Historique de l'Artillerie. Old Quebec is one of Canada's most popular historical areas and is well developed for tourism. In addition to the historical sites, other highlights include artists displaying their works on Rue du Trésor; interesting museums, like the Musée de la Civilisation; and unique shops and restaurants.",

Adding to its splendor are delicate inlaid floral patterns and precious and semi-precious stones such as jade, lapis lazuli, diamonds, and mother of pearl. The best time to visit is either at dawn or dusk when the atmosphere is brilliantly altered by the change in lighting.

The New Vishwanath Temple with its seven separate temples is also of interest. Bathing in the Ganges is of great importance to Hindus, and numerous locations known as ghats feature stairways leading to the water where the faithful bathe before prayers. The largest are Dasashvamedh Ghat and Assi Ghat. The latter, at the confluence of the Ganges and Asi rivers, is considered particularly holy. Also worth seeing is Banaras Hindu University, established in 1917 and noted for its massive library with more than a million books, and the superb Bharat Kala Bhavan museum featuring fine collections of miniature paintings, sculptures, palm-leaf manuscripts, and local history exhibits.",

In addition to its splendid design, visitors are equally impressed with the temple's spiritual atmosphere, an effect enhanced by the prayers continuously chanted from the Sikh holy book and broadcast throughout the complex.

Exhibitions at the excellent Stonehenge visitor center set the stage for a visit, explaining through audio-visual experiences and more than 250 ancient objects how the megaliths were erected between 3000 and 1500 BC, and sharing information about life during this time. After walking around the various viewing points adjacent to these enormous stones, visit the authentic replicas of Neolithic Houses to see the tools and implements of everyday Neolithic life as volunteers demonstrate skills from 4,500 years ago. Although you can't go inside the circle to wander among the stones during normal opening hours, you can reserve special early morning or late evening access into the circle through English Heritage, which manages the site.",

            description: "Known in China as Chang Jiang (Long River), the mighty Yangtze River extends more than 6,000 kilometers, making it the longest and most important river in China and the third longest in the world after the Amazon and the Nile. Flowing from Tibet in the west to Shanghai in the east through eight provinces, the Yangtze has, for more than 2,000 years, been China's major transportation route (some 2,700 kilometers are navigable). Its vast catchment area, with its 700 tributaries, cover about one-fifth of the total area of the country and encompass a quarter of the country's agricultural land. While its immense length ensures the river can be visited at numerous points in China, by far the most popular for tourists is the beautiful Three Gorges – Qutang, Wu, and Xiling – a 200-kilometer stretch between the towns of Fengjie and Yichang. In places a mix of raging torrents and dangerous shallows, here the river winds its way through the gorges and their rugged cliffs and high mountain peaks in a stretch of scenery as dramatic as the Grand Canyon.",

Of the surviving restored gardens, the most famous is the delightful Garden of Lingering, a seven-acre site laid out in 1800 on the site of a park originally created during the Ming Dynasty. One of the most famous garden complexes in China, the garden boasts a pool, several attractive buildings, a man-made hill, a grove of peach trees, and a lovely covered pathway on the walls of which hang more than three hundred stone tablets engraved with old Chinese characters.",

The first of the two Potala Palaces, the Red Palace, was built in the 17th century and contains the complex's most important shrines. These are found in the Enthronement Hall, the walls of which are covered with murals depicting scenes from the lives of the Dalai Lamas and the Tibetan kings. Other highlights of the Red Palace are its many vast halls devoted to the religion's teachings, and the elaborate tombs (known as stupas) of a number of Dalai Lamas. The equally impressive White Palace was completed in 1648 and includes the sleeping quarters, studies, and reception rooms, most untouched since 1959 when the Dalai Lama fled Tibet. While in Lhasa, be sure to visit the superb Jewel Gardens. Part of the Dalai Lama's summer residence, these 90-acre gardens were first started in the 1840s and encompass everything from grand palaces and pavilions to pleasant lakes.",
